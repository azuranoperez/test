1. Yes, it could be achieved by uploading the csv files into a table called thirdparty. This table would have the following fields: 
   timestamp (timestamp of insertion), metric, rate_paid, rate_charged, campaign_id (primary key), start_date and end_date.

   To ensure data accuracy, an optimal schedule plan should be determined by looking at how often the csv files are updated.
    
   The upload will be not done directly onto the table, but on a temporary table with the same structure. The main table will be updated afterwards 
   with the new entries using a procedure.

   An alternative could be to create users and grant them permissions (insert) accordingly. 

   To ensure data integrity, start_date and end_date fields on campaigns table will have to comply with charge start date and charge end date on thirdparty. 

2. Adding a new column, data_cost (DC), to the delivery_by_day table. This field will be populated after each updating process on thirdparty by a procedure. This procedure 
   will calculate the data cost as follows:

      - It will look for rows with new inserted campaign_id and a valid date. 

      - It will calculate data_cost based on the metric and the rates from thirdparty

   Profitability could be then calculated for each campaign in any time scale as CC-MC-DC/CC with the fields cost_to_client, media_cost and data_cost

3. Yes, by using the timestamp field of thirdparty table. It could be feasible, if the uploading process is not very frequent, to insert the csv file timestamp
   in the timestamp field.
